Hiya everyone, 

Welcome to my humble abode. I'm Ilona, I like monkeys and hacking stuff, hence **Ch1mp3y** is born. This website contains my capture the flag adventures, tips and tricks and all the hacking knowledge I learn along the way.

I started this blog because "my memory is leaking like a sieve" as we say in Dutch.  It's mostly for me, but if you enjoy reading and learning from it even the better! 

So sit back and enjoy the ride with me, or slowly walk away, it is all good in the house of **Ch1mp3y**.
  
**Mi casa es tu casa, pero mi taco es mi taco!**
